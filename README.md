# Hand-Detection-App
I have weird habit of scratching my face while I get stuck by a random bug in code or while attending a boring class meeting.  Some of us have bad habit of biting nails with their teeth.  So I saw a hand detection project online and thought why not give a try to get rid of my habits.  Here I can use my webcam to detect my hand near my face using handtrack.js which is built on tensorflow.  That will alarm me through a audio signal to stop. Now this is not the most advance thing in the domain  but it does it's thing.
